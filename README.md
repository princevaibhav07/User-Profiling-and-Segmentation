# User Profiling and Segmentation

This project analyzes **online behavior across age groups**, focusing on weekly time spent online. The goal is to uncover trends and insights that can be used for **user profiling and segmentation**â€”essential for understanding target audiences and improving business decision-making.

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

In this project, we:
- Explored patterns in **online engagement** across various age demographics.
- Visualized the data using a **bar chart** showing the average weekly time spent online for different age groups.
- Gained insights into digital behavior, particularly the consistency of online engagement across most groups.

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- **Data Analysis**: Conducted in-depth analysis of weekly time spent online across age groups.
- **Data Visualization**: Clear and impactful bar charts with error bars to show variability.
- **User Insights**: Trends and actionable insights for tailoring strategies in marketing, product development, and more.

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **Pandas**: To handle and analyze datasets.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For creating visualizations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: To document and share the analysis interactively.

## ðŸ’¡ Insights from the Project
- **Consistency**: Weekly online time is similar across most age groups, challenging assumptions about digital engagement by age.
- **Older Adults (65+)**: Show slightly lower online engagement, which aligns with trends in digital adoption.
